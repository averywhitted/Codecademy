      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            The element generates a block box, generating line breaks both
            before and after the element when in the normal flow.
          </td>
          <td>
            The element generates one or more inline boxes that do not generate
            line breaks before or after themselves. In normal flow, the next
            element will be on the same line if there is space.
          </td>
          <td>
            The element generates a block box that will be flowed with
            surrounding content as if it were a single inline box (behaving much
            like a replaced element would). It is equivalent to inline
            flow-root.
